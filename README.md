# SQL- Case Study: Danny Diner

## Problem Statement:

Danny wants to use the data to answer a few simple questions about his customers, especially about their
- visiting patterns,
- how much money they’ve spent, and
- which menu items are their favourite.

## Goal:

Having this deeper connection with his customers will help him deliver a better and more personalised experience for his loyal customers.

He plans on using these insights to help him decide whether he should expand the existing customer loyalty program — additionally he needs help to generate some basic datasets so his team can easily inspect the data without needing to use SQL.
